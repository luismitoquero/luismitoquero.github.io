My name is Luismi and I am an assistant professor of Spanish Linguistics at California State University Fullerton in the department of Modern Languages and Literatures. My primary area of research is theoretical syntax, and its interface with semantics and morphology. I earned my PhD in linguistics from the University of Southern California in 2024.

While there is a series of properties that all languages share (universal principles) there is also room for language-specific variation. I aim to discover what some of these universal principles are and the limits on possible variation. One area where we see a lot of that variation is the domain of numerals, measure words, and determiner selection as instantiated by the count-mass distinction across languages. I find that by closely examing the morpho-syntactic properties of the phenomena, while considering semantic insights, we can uncover new generalizations that link structure to meaning and help us to better understand how the different modules interact. 
In addition, languages may vary in terms of displacement properties. In other words, while movement is likely a universal property of human languages, the mechanisms that constrain those movement operations need not be universally available. Thus, I investigate the restrictions that the grammar places on the formation of movement dependencies, their interactions with other mechanisms such as agreement and the consequences that movement operations have at the interface, including linerazation, scope and parasitic gap licensing.   

I have a strong commitment to studying underrepresented languages by conducting in-situ and ex-situ fieldwork. I have done fieldwork on Alasha Mongolian, rural Iberian Spanishes and Ch'ol (in collaboration with Carol-Rose Little). Besides, though I mostly do theoretical work, I have been involved in some experimental research.
